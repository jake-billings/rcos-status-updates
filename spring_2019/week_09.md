## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

We've made a ton of progress since the last status update.

The following pull requests exemplify some of the finished Spaceport frontend features.

 - Last week, we made incremental code progress (see commits from team members)
    - Saketh developed the GUI components for search
    - Mik made progress on the Project and Projects views
    - Since Aaron is already done with the articles views, he's started working on design and research for the backend API.
 - I made a lot of progress refining the design and product spec with Ethan. We were running out of work to give developers, and now we have a direction to work toward.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

 - Finish search
 - Finish article backend using GitHub API and Markdown Articles
 - Finish Project/Project views

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

Nothing is currently blocking this project.

## Notes

I'm currently working in a project management type role. I'm searching for more code stuff to do.
