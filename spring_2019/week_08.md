## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

We've made a ton of progress since the last status update.

The following pull requests exemplify some of the finished Spaceport frontend features.

 - Add Project + Projects pages using mock data
    - https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/pull/31
 - Article view that displays article content using mock data
    - https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/pull/34
 - Create the "curriculums" view using mock data
    - https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/pull/35

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

 - Merge pull requests and assign new tasks to team members with free capacity
 - Make the styling of the application consistent using bootstrap
 - Redeploy AWS configuration using IAM roles

 My role for coding: Redeploy AWS lambdas under proper AWS IAM role. This requires me to setup IAM roles.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

Nothing is currently blocking this project.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I'm currently working in a project management type role. I'm searching for more code stuff to do.
