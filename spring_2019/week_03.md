## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

There was some miscommunication and difficulty making progress due to the long period of time between small group meetings.

We met about progress today, and code is coming along quickly.

Now that we're moving again, group members have completed the following GitHub issues:

- https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/issues/21
- https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/issues/18
- https://github.com/codingandcommunity/spaceport/issues/17

Product planning has improved. We are now pursuing a complete site search as opposed to searches in each individual view.

Trello has been updated for the past week.

The projects page is complete, and in the process of being merged.

The articles views are complete.

The curriculums views are almost complete.

## This Week's Plan

Nothing is currently blocking this project.
