## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

- Learn Mocha/Chai Testing Framework
- Add Mocha/Chai boilerplate and `yarn test command`

I didn't actually get the chance to work with the Atom Plugin Team to refine the design yet, so this week's plan is the same as last week's plan. The work still needs to be done.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

- Work with the Atom Plugin Team to ensure that they can access the project API endpoint
- Add documentation for the projects endpoint

I didn't actually get the chance to work with the Atom Plugin Team to refine the design yet, so this week's plan is the same as last week's plan. The work still needs to be done.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

Communication with Plugin Team about what they need from the API

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

Still not quite sure if I'm doing too much or not enough for RCOS. Feedback is greatly appreciated.
