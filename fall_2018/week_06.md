## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

- Productivity was actually pretty low this week. I'm now blocked because the plugin and website teams don't know what data they need (see _Anything Blocking?_).
- Decided to move to the frontend website team because I can't be very productive working on the backend right now.
- I have a compulsive need to commit code for RCOS, so I worked on the `rpi-validator` library last week. I added package badges and icons to the README file. I also fixed a bug in the package exports. See the following commits:

I didn't actually get the chance to work with the Atom Plugin Team to refine the design yet, so this week's plan is the same as last week's plan. The work still needs to be done.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

- I plan to work with the frontend website team this week.
- I will learn the framework they are using.
- I will start work with them on the boilerplate for the frontend of the website.
- If I have trouble finding productive contributions to make on the frontend project, I plan to contribute to the "Hello World" example project. This is not a "Hello World" project for us. It is a repository that the final plugin will use to help students build the boilerplate for a frontend web application.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I am currently blocked on contributing the the backend of this project because I don't know what data the website and plugin need. I am switching roles so that I can contribute to the frontend website for this project.
