Last week was Thanksgiving break. I spent some quality time with relatives. However, I did not work much on this project.

The following accomplishments occurred the week before break:

- Create the *Omniscience* project for Coding&&Community
    - Repo: https://github.com/codingandcommunity/omniscience
    - Uses `Mocha` and `node-fetch` to quickly verify which websites are online and which aren't
        - The Coding&&Community website went down and nobody knew. This should help alert people in the future.
    - Verifies the following web properties:
        - https://codingandcommunity.org
        - https://www.codingandcommunity.org
        - https://spaceport.codingandcommunity.org

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

- Continue to work with the website team so that everyone can be productive in the repository.
- Mik wrote an HTML page that needs to be converted to JSX. We plan to integrate this html to the JSX project structure. (This didn't get done last week.)
- Start work on the large group presentation for our subgroup.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

We're having trouble working as a group because everybody has very different levels of experience working with React. Getting everybody up to speed so we can work is a continuing challenge.
